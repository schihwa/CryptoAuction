**Distributed Auctioning System Design Using Java RMI**

This project involves developing a distributed auctioning system using Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI), featuring a central auction server and a client interface. The system will support essential auction functions such as listing items, managing bids, and closing auctions.

### Key System Functions

1. **User Management**: The system allows users to register, receiving a unique ID upon successful registration.
   
2. **Auction Operations**:
   - **Create Auctions**: Users can initiate new auctions, each with a unique identifier.
   - **View Listings**: Clients can retrieve a list of current auctions.
   - **Place Bids**: Registered users can bid on listed items.
   - **Close Auctions**: Auctions can be closed, and the system announces the winning bid if applicable.

3. **Interface and Class Structure**:
   - The main interface (`Auction`) manages auction actions like `register`, `newAuction`, `listItems`, `bid`, and `closeAuction`.
   - Supporting classes include `AuctionItem` (describing auction items), `AuctionSaleItem` (details for sale initiation), and `AuctionResult` (announcing winners).

### Advanced Features: Secure Access with Cryptographic Authentication

An enhanced version incorporates RSA-based authentication to ensure secure, verified access. This includes:

- **Challenge-Response Authentication**: Using a 2048-bit RSA key, the server responds to a client’s unique challenge. Clients return a verified digital signature, validated by the server before further interaction.
- **Token-Based Access Control**: After successful authentication, the server provides a short-lived, one-time token for secure, subsequent actions like viewing listings, creating bids, or closing auctions.

### Technical Requirements

- **Authentication Methods**: The server uses RSA keys for signing and verifying requests, leveraging SHA256withRSA for digital signature creation.
- **State Management**: All data on auctions and user sessions are maintained in memory, simplifying management for multiple clients interacting concurrently.
  
This system will provide a responsive, scalable solution for online auctions, emphasizing both fundamental auction functions and optional layers of security.
