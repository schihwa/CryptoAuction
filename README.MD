# CryptoAuction: A Distributed Auctioning System with Java RMI

Welcome to **CryptoAuction**! This Java-based application leverages **Remote Method Invocation (RMI)** to create a secure, scalable auction platform where users can list items, place bids, and close auctions in real-time. Designed with both core auction functionality and advanced security measures, this project provides a robust solution for online auctions.

## Project Overview

CryptoAuction operates with a **central auction server** and **multiple client applications** that connect to manage and participate in auctions. Key components include user registration, auction management, and secure bidding.

The architecture emphasizes object-oriented programming principles and implements **asymmetric cryptographic authentication** for secure user access.

## Features

### Core Features

- **User Registration**: New users register with an email to receive a unique user ID.
- **Auction Management**:
  - **Create Auctions**: Users can initiate new auctions with item details and a reserve price.
  - **View Listings**: All ongoing auctions can be listed for users to browse.
  - **Place Bids**: Registered users can place bids on open auction items.
  - **Close Auctions**: Auctions can be closed, and winning bids are determined.
  
### Advanced Security

- **RSA-based Challenge-Response Authentication**:
  - Clients authenticate by responding to a server challenge using RSA-2048 encryption.
  - **Token-Based Access**: After authentication, a one-time-use token enables further requests securely.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java JDK 8 or higher**
- **RMI Registry** (Java's built-in service)
- **RSA Key Pair Generator** for public/private keys in the `keys` directory (only for advanced security).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cryptoauction.git
   cd cryptoauction
   ```

2. **Compile the Code**:
   ```bash
   javac -d bin src/*.java
   ```

3. **Start the RMI Registry** (from the project root directory):
   ```bash
   rmiregistry &
   ```

4. **Run the Server**:
   ```bash
   sh server.sh
   ```

5. **Launch the Client** (from a new terminal):
   ```bash
   java -cp bin Client
   ```

## Project Structure

- **src/** – Contains all Java source files for the server, client, and interfaces.
- **bin/** – Compiled Java bytecode files.
- **keys/** – Public key for RSA-based authentication (for advanced mode).
- **server.sh** – Shell script to initialize the server.

## How It Works

The core functionality is based on Java RMI, enabling remote interactions between the auction server and clients. Here’s a brief on how each module works:

1. **Auction Server**: Manages auction listings, handles bids, and communicates with clients.
2. **Client Application**: Allows users to register, browse listings, place bids, and close auctions.
3. **RSA Authentication** (optional): Secures client-server communication with challenge-response using RSA keys.

### Key Classes & Interfaces

- `Auction`: Main interface for auction actions.
- `AuctionItem`, `AuctionSaleItem`, `AuctionResult`: Models that define auction items, sale initiation, and bid results.
- **Security Classes**: For RSA-based token management and digital signature verification.

## Usage Examples

1. **Register a User**:
   ```java
   int userId = auction.register("user@example.com");
   ```
2. **Create a New Auction**:
   ```java
   int auctionId = auction.newAuction(userId, new AuctionSaleItem("Item Name", "Description", 100));
   ```
3. **Place a Bid**:
   ```java
   boolean success = auction.bid(userId, auctionId, 150);
   ```
4. **Close an Auction**:
   ```java
   AuctionResult result = auction.closeAuction(userId, auctionId);
   ```

## Security Protocols

If running in advanced mode, the system uses:

- **RSA-2048** for encryption and **SHA256withRSA** for digital signatures.
- **One-Time Tokens** for authenticated sessions, with a short expiration for enhanced security.

## Class Definitions

Ensure that each of the following classes and methods is implemented according to specification:

- **Auction Interface**:
  - `register`, `newAuction`, `listItems`, `bid`, `closeAuction`, etc.
- **Security Methods**:
  - `challenge`, `authenticate` for RSA-based authentication.

## Future Enhancements

Potential future developments could include:

- **Persistent Storage**: Store auction and user data in a database for long-term availability.
- **Web Interface**: Implement a front-end UI for enhanced user interaction.
- **Enhanced Security**: Integrate multi-factor authentication for additional security.
